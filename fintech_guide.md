2. He enters:
   - Priya‚Äôs mobile wallet number (MobiCash).  
   - Amount: ‚Çπ10,000 (‚âà $120 USD).  
3. PayFast sends a **money transfer API request** to Fintech‚Äôs system.  
4. This API request contains:
   - Sender details (**KYC, compliance**).  
   - Receiver details.  
   - Amount.  
   - Purpose of transaction.  
   - Partner authentication (**via whitelisted IP & SSL cert**).

### **Step 2 ‚Äì Fintech Routes to Receive Partner**
1. Fintech receives the API call from PayFast (**Send Partner**).  
2. Fintech converts the amount into the target currency (**KES ‚Äì Kenyan Shillings**).  
3. Fintech sends an **API request** to MobiCash (**Receive Partner**) with:
   - Receiver wallet ID.  
   - Amount in KES.  
   - Reference ID.  
4. This communication is secured via:
   - Partner IP whitelisting (to avoid fraud).

### **Step 3 ‚Äì MobiCash Credits Priya**

   - Transaction ID.  
   - Time of completion.

### **Step 4 ‚Äì Fintech Sends Sender Callback**
