Understanding the Architecture
The architecture described involves several components often used in FinTech organizations like TerraPay. Here's a breakdown of the components, their roles, and how they interact:

1. EIG Server:
Purpose: Hosts APIs and services that partners connect to for exchanging financial data or initiating transactions.

Directory Setup:
/prd/EIG_OUT/SSL/client_ssls: A secure directory for storing SSL certificates, likely used for encrypting communication with partners.

FinTech Context:
EIG servers are typically the backend systems that handle partner interactions, such as API calls for fund transfers, account validation, or transaction reporting.

2. Jump Server:
Purpose: Acts as a secured gateway for accessing other servers in the architecture.

Directory Setup:
/prd/utils/setupiptables.sh: Likely a script for managing iptables, which is a Linux utility for configuring firewall rules.

FinTech Context:
Used to enhance security by isolating access to critical servers (like the EIG or VPN servers). All administrative access is routed through this server.

3. VPN Server:
Purpose: Handles VPN tunnels, enabling secure communication between the organization's servers and external partners.

Directory Setup:
/etc/ipsec.d/: Configuration and storage directory for IPsec-related settings and secrets.

FinTech Context:
VPN servers are essential for securely transmitting sensitive financial data between partners and the organization's internal systems.

Libreswan: A widely used open-source IPsec VPN implementation, enabling secure site-to-site or client-to-site VPNs.

4. All Tunnels Directory Setup:
Purpose:
/root/vpnsetup/setupiptables.sh: A script likely for configuring IPtables rules related to VPN tunnels.

FinTech Context:
These scripts automate the setup of firewall rules that define which traffic is allowed through the VPN tunnels, ensuring only whitelisted partner IPs can access internal services.

5. Partner Connection to EIG Server:
Purpose: The partner connects to the EIG server to access APIs for payment processing, validation, or other services.
Whitelisting: Only specific IPs are allowed to connect, ensuring unauthorized entities cannot access sensitive systems.
FinTech Context:
Partners use APIs to interact with the organization's systems for services like remittances, payments, or transaction queries.
Whitelisting ensures secure and controlled access.

6. Transaction (TXN) Server:
Purpose: Handles the processing of financial transactions.
FinTech Context:
Manages the flow of transactions, ensuring they are processed securely and efficiently. May also interface with payment gateways and banks.

7. Reporting (RPT) Server:
Purpose: Handles reporting and analytics related to financial transactions.
FinTech Context:
Provides partners and internal teams with transaction reports, settlement details, and compliance metrics.

8. How These Components Work Together:
Partner → VPN Server: Partners connect to the VPN server using a secure VPN tunnel, allowing them to reach internal services.
VPN Server → EIG Server: The VPN server forwards traffic from the partner to the EIG server, where APIs are hosted.
EIG Server ↔ TXN Server: The EIG server communicates with the transaction server to process financial requests.
TXN Server → RPT Server: The transaction server logs transaction details in the reporting server for analytics and compliance.
Jump Server: Administrators use the jump server to manage these servers securely.
